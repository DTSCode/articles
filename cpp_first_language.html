                <h4>C++ as a first language</h4><br />
                <p>Unfortunately, despite what people will tell you, there is no perfect first language. Each has its own pros and cons. This article only lists those relevant to the C++ programming language. For other languages (such as python, perl, C, etc.) feel free to drop me a line.

C++, while originally being created as a systems programming language, is currently classified as a general programming language. The upside to this is C++ fits many solutions, which also means it is very verbose and a big language to learn. The following is a non-exhaustive list of benenfits and issues with C++, which hopefully will help you decide if C++ is right for you.
